        <h2>What about dinosaurs?</h2>
            <p>These famous animals lived between about 245 and 66 million
                years ago. They lived more than our young species Homo sapiens so far.</p>
            <p>Dinosaur are prehistoric reptiles such as crocodiles and lizards,
                but their can be differentiate by their legs position respect to the
                ground.</p>
            <p>Lizards have bones almost parallel to the ground, dinosaurs on
                the other hand.</p>
        <h3>Linking birds and dinosaurs</h3>
        <ul class="dash">
            <li>-Wishbones</li>
            <li>-Feathers</li>
            <li>-Breastbones</li>
            <li>-Wrist that contain a crescent t-shaped bone</li>
            <li>-Hands like most other advanced theropods, with three
                fingers in which the middle finger is the longest</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What is the furcula</h4>
            <p>It is a bone in front of a breastbone that is shape like a V and
                consist chiefly of two fused clavicles.</p>
        <h5>How show the relation between species?</h5>
            <p>There is something call phylogenies and
                is way to represent how every living species has some relative
                on the basis of the morphology.</p>
        <h6>Non-avian dinosaurs vs Avian dinosaurs</h6>
                <p>Birds are one kind of dinosaur because they share a
                    common ancestor with non-avian dinosaurs</p>
                <p>Non-avian dinosaurs are call to all dinosaurs besides
                    birds and they are already extinct.</p>
